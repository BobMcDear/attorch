# Examples

This folder - inspired by [```pytorch/examples```](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/) - contains a few common deep learning examples whose backends can be switched between PyTorch and attorch to demonstrate attorch's usage and time it against PyTorch. Each example implements relevant models with the option to switch between PyTorch and attorch, and backend-agnostic training can be conducted by running the designated ```main.py``` file, which also performs benchmarks.

The examples are listed below.

* [Imagenette image classification](https://github.com/bobmcdear/attorch/examples/imagenette)
* [WikiText-2 language modelling](https://github.com/bobmcdear/attorch/examples/wikitext-2)
* [MNIST classification](https://github.com/bobmcdear/attorch/examples/mnist)
* [Synthetic regression](https://github.com/bobmcdear/attorch/examples/regression)
